# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment retail store customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, using the Mall Customers dataset from Kaggle.

## 📌 Overview

Customer segmentation helps businesses better understand their customer base and optimize marketing strategies. In this project, we:

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualized customer features
- Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Used K-Means Clustering to group similar customers
- Visualized the results
